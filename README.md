- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitHubOfAndrew
- 👀 Studied mathematics and physics with emphasis on topology and high-energy physics theory. I am now a data scientist with thorough experience in machine learning.  My repository will likely contain all of the following: 1) math/physics notes from past courses 2) math/physics problem set solutions 3) any research papers/projects 4) coding projects 5) datasets + data science projects.
- 🌱 I am interested in data science and have extensive experience programming with Python and navigating and querying from relational databases. I am experienced in building recommender systems and aggregating and validating large datasets. My primary interest right now is deep learning and computer vision.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on machine-learning or data mining projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email for all academic things are accountofandrew@berkeley.edu.  My professional/work email is AndrewJYCh@gmail.com.
- **Important: You are free to extract, clone, pull any of the things on my repository, in fact, I WANT people to do so. I just ask you to please credit me/link to my github page if you are using it for professional/business/academic purposes. I am more than happy to provide you with my works, but all I ask is to please give me credit!**

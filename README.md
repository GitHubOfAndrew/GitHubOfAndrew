- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitHubOfAndrew
- 👀 Studied mathematics and physics with emphasis on topology and high-energy physics theory. I am now a data scientist with thorough experience in machine learning.  My repository will likely contain all of the following: 1) math/physics notes from past courses 2) math/physics problem set solutions 3) any research papers/projects 4) coding projects 5) datasets + data science projects.
- 🌱 I am interested in data science and have extensive experience programming with Python and navigating and querying from relational databases. I am experienced in building recommender systems and aggregating and validating large datasets. My primary interest right now is deep learning and computer vision.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on machine-learning or data mining projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email for all academic things are accountofandrew@berkeley.edu.  My professional/work email is AndrewJYCh@gmail.com.

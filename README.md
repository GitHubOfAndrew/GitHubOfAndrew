- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitHubOfAndrew
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and physics.  In particular, I have extensive experience in category theory and topology.  I am currently learning algebraic geometry and higher category theory.  My repository will likely contain all of the following: 1) math/physics notes from past courses 2) math/physics problem set solutions 3) any research papers/projects 4) coding projects 5) datasets + data science projects.
- 🌱 I am interested in data science and have extensive experience programming with Python, SQL, Matlab, and the Wolfram Language.  I am in the process of learning Julia and Haskell.  I am also familiar with, and further learning how to use machine learning for predictive modeling and other tasks.  I am learning how to use and build neural networks, and I am looking to get into deep learning projects.  A bunch of my repos will likely contain my attempts at predicting results on kaggle datasets and individual projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any mathematics or physics-related projects, particularly regarding String Theory or High Energy Physics.  I am also looking to collaborate on machine-learning or data mining projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email for all academic things are accountofandrew@berkeley.edu.  My professional/work email is AndrewJYCh@gmail.com.

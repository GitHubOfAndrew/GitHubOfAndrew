- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitHubOfAndrew
- 👀 I’m interested in mathematics and physics.  In particular, I like category theory and topology, and most of my mathematics experience is with those topics.  I am also a programming enthusiast and I currently familiar with Python, SQL, Matlab, the Wolfram Language, and Haskell.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning category theory and programming in Haskell.  My hopes are to view all of mathematics and science through the language of category theory.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any mathematics or physics-related projects, particularly regarding String Theory or High Energy Physics.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email for all academic things are accountofandrew@berkeley.edu.  My professional/work email is AndrewJYCh@gmail.com.

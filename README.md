- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitHubOfAndrew
- 👀 Studied mathematics and physics with emphasis on topology and high-energy physics theory. I am now a data scientist with thorough machine learning experience.  My repository contains a lot of random works of mine. From implementations of particular algorithms/methods, full-scale, end-to-end data science/machine learning projects, Kaggle practice notebooks, etc. There are also some mathematics and physics works I've done in the past, however, this will be exclusively my data science and machine learning projects from here on out.
- 🌱 I am passionate about machine learning and I am an expert in Python programming and managing relational databases (MySQL and PostgreSQL). I am experienced in Natural Language Processing and building recommender systems. I am also experienced in organizing in presenting data through dashboards/visualizations as well.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on machine-learning projects. I love sports analytics (particularly basketball analytics).
- 📫 How to reach me: My email for all academic things are accountofandrew@berkeley.edu.  My professional/work email is AndrewJYCh@gmail.com.

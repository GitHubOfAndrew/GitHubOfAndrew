- 👋 Hi, I’m @GitHubOfAndrew
- 👀 Studied mathematics and physics with emphasis on topology and high-energy physics theory. I am now a data scientist with thorough (and growing) experience in machine learning.  My repository contains a lot of random works of mine. From implementations of particular algorithms/methods, full-scale, end-to-end data science/machine learning projects, Kaggle practice notebooks, etc. There are also some mathematics and physics works I've done in the past, however, this will be exclusively my data science or machine learning projects from here on out.
- 🌱 I am interested in data science and have extensive experience programming with Python and navigating and querying from relational databases. I am experienced in building recommender systems and aggregating and validating large datasets. My primary interest right now is deep learning and computer vision.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on machine-learning projects.
- 📫 How to reach me: My email for all academic things are accountofandrew@berkeley.edu.  My professional/work email is AndrewJYCh@gmail.com.
- **Important: You are free to extract, clone, pull any of the things on my repository, in fact, I WANT people to do so. I just ask you to please credit me/link to my github page if you are using it for professional/business/academic purposes. I am more than happy to provide you with my works, but all I ask is to please give me credit!**

## Follow me on my machine learning and data science journey.
